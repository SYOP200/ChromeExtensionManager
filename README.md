# TROUBLESHOOTING PROCESS 

If it appears that there is a error it could be for two reasons. You may not have Psutil installed. If this is so you should see a message thats says "Error when loading Psutil" you can install Psutil by following the process below. 
Rarely you can experience a script error. If this occurs, let us know in the Wiki- https://github.com/SYOP200/ChromeExtensionManager.wiki.git  
You can easily tell if there is an unknown script error if there is a white screen or it appears that nothing works.
You can try to reopen to refresh the site if it crashes.
If you recieve an error message, it will most likly be patched in the next update/Release.
